# Build and Deployment Setup

This document outlines the build system, containerization strategy, and inferred deployment environment for the Nayonika Eye Care API application.

## 1. Build System

-   **Build Tool:** The project uses **Apache Maven** as its build automation tool, identified by the presence of a `pom.xml` file.
-   **Spring Boot Version:** The application is built upon **Spring Boot version 3.4.4**, as specified in the `<parent>` section of the `pom.xml`.
-   **Java Version:** The project is configured to use **Java 24**, as indicated by the `<java.version>24</java.version>` property in `pom.xml`.
-   **Output Artifact:** The build process, managed by the `spring-boot-maven-plugin`, produces an executable **JAR file**. This is the standard packaging for Spring Boot applications, suitable for direct execution or containerization.

## 2. Containerization

Containerization is facilitated using Docker, with configurations provided in `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

### Dockerfile (`api/Dockerfile`)

-   **Base Image:** `openjdk:24-jdk` is used as the base image, providing the Java 24 runtime environment.
-   **Application Source:** The entire project source code is copied into the container (`COPY . .`).
-   **Build and Run Process:**
    *   The command `CMD ["./mvnw", "spring-boot:run"]` is used to run the application.
    *   **Observation:** This approach means the application is compiled and run using the Maven wrapper *inside* the container upon startup. While convenient for development or creating a self-contained build-and-run image, it's not optimal for production. Production Docker images typically copy a pre-built JAR (e.g., from a CI/CD pipeline or a multi-stage Docker build) for faster startup times, smaller image sizes (by excluding build dependencies), and more consistent builds.
-   **Port Exposure:** Port `8080` is exposed from the container, which is the default port for Spring Boot applications unless overridden by `server.port` in the application configuration.
-   **Environment Variables:** No environment variables are explicitly set using `ENV` instructions within the Dockerfile. Configuration is likely managed through Spring profiles and externalized configuration files or environment variables passed at runtime.

### Docker Compose (`api/docker-compose.yml`)

-   **Service Definition:** A single service named `nayonika-apis` is defined.
-   **Image Source:**
    *   The service uses the image `nayonika-api-img`.
    *   **Observation:** The `docker-compose.yml` does not include a `build` context for this service. This implies that the `nayonika-api-img` is expected to be **pre-built** (e.g., using a `docker build` command with the Dockerfile, potentially tagged, and then referenced here) or pulled from a container registry. This contrasts slightly with the Dockerfile's `CMD` which can build if the source is present. For `docker-compose` to work as written, the image `nayonika-api-img` must exist locally or in a configured registry.
-   **Port Mapping:** `8080:8080` maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the `nayonika-apis` container.
-   **Environment Variables/Secrets:** No environment variables or secrets are explicitly passed to the service within the `docker-compose.yml`. This suggests that if environment-specific configurations (like database URIs or JWT secrets for `dev`/`qa` profiles) are needed when using Docker Compose, they would need to be supplied through other means (e.g., an `.env` file used by `docker-compose`, or by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` to include an `environment` section).
-   **Volumes:** No volumes are defined for persistent storage or configuration mounting.

## 3. Inferred Deployment Environment

-   **Cloud Provider:** Based on the `@CrossOrigin` annotations found in controllers (e.g., `PatientController.java`), which list URLs like `http://nayonika-user-management-dev-1511095685.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com` and `http://nayonika-user-management-qa-580028363.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com`, it is strongly inferred that the application is deployed to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for its `dev` and `qa` environments.
-   **AWS Services:** The presence of `elb.amazonaws.com` in the URLs indicates the use of an **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** to distribute traffic to the application instances. The application itself is likely running on services like:
    *   Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
    *   Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
    *   Or potentially EC2 instances managed with Docker.
-   **Regional Deployment:** The URLs also indicate deployment in the `ap-south-1` (Asia Pacific - Mumbai) AWS region.

## 4. Summary of Observations

-   The application uses a standard Maven build for Spring Boot, producing a JAR.
-   The Dockerfile provides a way to run the application in a container, but its current `CMD` suggests a build-and-run approach within the container, which is more suited for development. For production, a multi-stage build producing a lean image with a pre-built JAR is recommended.
-   The `docker-compose.yml` is simple and relies on a pre-built image, suitable for local orchestration or simple multi-container setups.
-   Deployment for dev and QA environments appears to be on AWS, utilizing Elastic Load Balancers. Production deployment details are not directly inferable from these files but would ideally follow similar cloud-native patterns with enhanced security and configuration management.
-   Configuration management for sensitive data (like DB credentials, JWT secrets) in containerized environments needs careful attention, ideally using environment variables injected at runtime or secrets management services, rather than hardcoding in configuration files or Docker images.Okay, I have all the content from the previously generated markdown files. I will now compile them into the `NayonikaEyeCare_Analysis_Report.md` document, structuring it as requested.
